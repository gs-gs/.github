# GoSource

When creating repositories, ensure to follow this pattern:

`<client-acronym-or-abbrev>-<repo-name-with-dashes>`

Eg. `ha-trade-reform` or `health-mcf-frontend`

Sometimes the repo name should match the product, sometimes it should match the component(s) contained within. For more details, see the [handbook](https://staff-handbook.gosource.com.au/)
